## 1.0 Make groups

Divide the class into a few groups of no more than 4 people.

### 1.1 Choose a leader

Pick one person to become the group leader. This is just for the GitHub repository.

### 1.2 Fork the repository

At the top of this page, click on fork. This will create a duplicate of this repository and add it to your account.

### 1.3 Add teammates

Make sure everyone in your team has a GitHub account. Now, in your forked repository, click on settings -> Collaborators & teams. Add all of your teammates and make sure they accept the invite.

### 1.4 Pull the repository

Everybody has to clone the repository to their desktop using GitHub desktop (If you prefer a different Git Client or command line you may also use it).

## 2.0 The assignment

Open the files you just cloned from the remote repository in your favorite text editor or IDE.

### 2.1 Change the HTML

In index.html change the **ID** and **text** of a person to your name. (Divide the 4 lines between your group so nobody changes the same line)

```html
<div class="person" id="NAME-TEAM-MEMBER-1-HERE">Person 1</div>
```
To
```html
<div class="person" id="Max">Max ðŸ”ŒðŸ¤–</div>
```

### 2.2 Change the CSS
In style.css below line **31** add a new CSS id selector with your name and change the background to your favorite color.

## 3.0 Adding changes
Open GitHub Desktop and select all the changes you've made. You can select a few lines or the entire file. Give your commit a message that describes what you've changed. After that click **Commit to master**. After that click **Publish branche**.

## 4.0 View everyone's changes
When everyone is done with commiting and pushing their changes, click on **Fetch origin** and watch how all your changes come together in one project.
